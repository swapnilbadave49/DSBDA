1Ô∏è‚É£ Enable File Transfer Between Linux and CentOS (VirtualBox)
You have three options to transfer the file:

üìå Option 1: Using scp (Easiest & Recommended)
Find the IP address of CentOS (inside VirtualBox) using:


ip a | grep inet
Look for an IP like 192.168.x.x (assuming you have a NAT or Bridged Adapter enabled in VirtualBox).

Transfer the file from your Linux system to CentOS:

scp ~/Downloads/log_data.csv hadoop@192.168.x.x:/home/hadoop/
Replace hadoop with your CentOS username.

Replace 192.168.x.x with the actual IP of CentOS.

Verify on CentOS:


ls -lh /home/hadoop/
üìå Option 2: Using Shared Folders (VirtualBox Feature)
In VirtualBox, go to Settings ‚Üí Shared Folders.

Click "Add New Folder", select the directory where log_data.csv is stored on your Linux system.

Enable "Auto-mount" and "Make Permanent".

Inside CentOS, access the shared folder (usually at /media/sf_<foldername>).

üìå Option 3: Using a USB Drive (If VirtualBox Supports It)
Plug in a USB drive.

In VirtualBox ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí USB, select the USB.

Copy log_data.csv from Linux to the USB drive.

Mount the USB inside CentOS and copy the file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the File to HDFS
Once the file is inside CentOS (/home/hadoop/log_data.csv):

Switch to Hadoop user (if not already in Hadoop user)


su - hadoop
Upload to HDFS:

bash

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hadoop/input
hdfs dfs -put /home/hadoop/log_data.csv /user/hadoop/input
Verify File in HDFS:

hdfs dfs -ls /user/hadoop/input
